# The Post’s Machine Reloaded: Design, Implementation and Programming of a Small and Functional CPU Prototype

This repository contains the complete original code for the published [first Spanish edition, Open Edition eBook](https://github.com/galaguna/Posts_Machine_Reloaded_Booklet/releases/tag/First_Spanish_Edition), and the [first English edition, Open Edition eBook](https://github.com/galaguna/Posts_Machine_Reloaded_Booklet/releases/tag/First_English_Edition), both available from this repository.

In the refered booklet, the complete development of the design, implementation and programming of the prototype for a small central processing unit (CPU) is presented, starting with an improved variant of the Post’s Machine. The Post’s Machine is a theoretical development similar to that of Alan Turing, the famous mathematician considered to be one of the fathers of modern computing, although developed by Emil Post in an entirely original and independent way. The Post’s Machine is much simpler than Turing's, therefore, given its relative simplicity, it allows those interested to be introduced, in a clear way, to the basic concepts related to the operation of virtually every modern digital CPU. 

The development of the logical design of the corresponding digital system is explained, it is specified by means of Register Transfer Level (RTL) methodology, its codification is shown with VHDL language and it is implemented with the resources of a low cost FPGA development board. The prototype obtained could be used for the interested parties to experiment, in a very concrete and practical way, the concepts of micro-code, algorithm and programming, both in assembly language and in machine language.
  
Finally, it is demonstrated that it is possible to build, with relatively limited resources, a micro-processed system that allows the acquisition of the necessary knowledge and experience to be introduced in the field of design and application of modern digital systems. Therefore, this work can be used as a reference, both theoretical and practical, for any engineer, or computer and electronics amateurs, who wishes to go deeper into the details of the design and construction of a prototype for a simple but functional microprocessor. The material in this work can even be of great interest, in the academic environment, as a complementary textbook for the Advanced Logical Design, Micro-processing Systems and other related courses.


# Extending the project

To develop your own more elaborate versions of the prototype, please **fork** this. 

You can try de following:

* The specification for the design of the original prototype, given its pedagogical nature, contemplated a maximum code space of 256 nibbles and 256 bits for the data space. It is clear that this limitation can be easily overcome by modifying the code provided.  It should only be taken into account that any extension of these spaces has a direct impact on the number of bits required for the coding of jump instructions (machine code) and, therefore, on the design of the ASMD diagrams for the development of the machine cycles presented in the book.

* The speed of execution is another aspect that can also be modified, this one more immediately. The speed of execution of the prototype presented is very slow only to give the opportunity to observe the progress in the machine cycles. For this purpose, a divider is used for the system clock signal. To accelerate the speed of execution of the prototype, simply occupy another tap of the counter, which is used as a divider for the clock signal, or simply use the system clock signal.

* Finally, it is clear that the machine code of the prototype, as explained in the book, is generated manually by the programmer. It is an interesting challenge to develop an assembler program to generate the machine code from the source code with the instructions in assembler.
